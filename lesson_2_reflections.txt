What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing creates the empty, hidden .git folder. Without it, the versions couldn't be stored.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a temporary holding area. Files here will move to repository later. The staging area allows things to be changed before committing to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use git log and git diff to see differences between working directory, staging area, and repository to make sure you are ready to make a commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful if you want to make a fairly big change to the file that sends it in a new direction (making Mario the enemy, say). You can maintain the original direction of your file while trying new directions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
When you create many branches, it can get pretty wild. A diagram shows the path back to the master branch and initial commit in a fast manner.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The merge eliminates one branch label and combines many changes together while still preserving all prior commits for both branches.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Automatic merging requires Git to make assumptions about some of the conflicts, which makes things far easier but also can lead to issues.
