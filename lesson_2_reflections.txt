What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing creates the empty, hidden .git folder. Without it, the versions couldn't be stored.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a temporary holding area. Files here will move to repository later. The staging area allows things to be changed before committing to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use git log and git diff to see differences between working directory, staging area, and repository to make sure you are ready to make a commit.
