When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You may not have your computer with you, or perhaps someone requests behavior you may not want. Or maybe you just want to share it with a friend so they can work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can pull whenever you're ready. And you don't want it to update while you're in the middle of working on a file.
